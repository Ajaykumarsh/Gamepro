            <h4 >I have a love hate relationship with 3D fighters. Most of the time I avoid them as much as possible as I never really found one I truly like since Bushido Blade 1 and 2, but I understand why people enjoyed them. I did, however, have somewhat of a soft spot for the Soulcalibur series dating back all the way from the first arcade release of Soul Edge. Over time however the series slowly began to decline for myself with strange releases such as Legends and Broken Destiny, as well as questionable design choices such as new and guest characters.. Set after the release of Soulcalibur V and at the request of many fans, Bandai Namco attempts to return the series back to its former glory with Soulcalibur VI.</h4>
